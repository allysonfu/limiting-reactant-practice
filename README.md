# limiting-reactant-practice
This program is an exercise in chemistry wherein the user will need to use mole ratios and a simplified system of equations to deduce either
    (1) How much reactant was initially in a reaction vessel OR
    (2) How much product resulted
given the amount of excess reactant remaining after a reaction has gone to completion. To start the reaction, there are equal amounts of each reactant in the vessel, and none of the product has been produced yet. 

Each problem can be solved by hand as follows:
Ex. N₂ + 3H₂ -> 2NH₃
In this reaction, for every 1 mol of N₂ consumed, 3 mols of H₂ will be consumed. 
Given that the reaction vessel has equal amounts of both reactants to start, H₂ must be the limiting reactant because it is consumed (essentially) three times as quickly as N₂. From this, we can deduce that H₂ will be consumed completely by the end of the reaction, and the given amount of "excess reactant" relates to N₂. 

    This can be represented as:
    initial H₂ - 3y = 0
    initial N₂ - y = x (amount excess reactant - given in the problem) 
    initial H₂ = initial N₂ = initial


    initial - 3y = 0 --> initial = 3y
    initial - y = x

    3y - y = x --> 2y = x --> y = x/2
    inital NH₃ (0) + 2y = 2 * (x/2) = x = final NH₃

    And using molar ratios: final NH₃ * (3 mol H₂ / 2 mol NH₃) = inital H₂ = initial N₂
